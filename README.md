# RPS Challenge

As the challenge provided only two user stories I have broken down the second 'epic' request into smaller achievable user stories based on the functionailty that I believe the Rock, Paper, Scissors (RPS) game should have.

## Original two user stories

I would like to register my name before playing an online game
